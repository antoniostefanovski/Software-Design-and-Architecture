## Project Description

Known as the Land of the Sun, Macedonia offers an ideal climate and agricultural environment for producing high-quality wines. The wine industry in Macedonia has significantly developed in recent decades, with many family-owned and large wineries putting this country on the global wine map. Inspired by this, our team came up with an idea to contribute even more to the development of the wine industry.

The concept of our application is to enable users to learn more about the wineries themselves, the wines they offer, their location, the historical significance of the winery, and their position on the global ranking of renowned wineries. This application will be beneficial to the citizens of our country, but it will also make a significant contribution to the development of tourism in Macedonia.

The main functionality of the application is to display a map with the locations of famous wineries throughout Macedonia. Users can select a winery, and detailed information about the selected winery and its most famous wine varieties will be provided. Additionally, the application will showcase the currently most famous wineries and wines in the Macedonian territory. The idea behind this application is to serve its users, allowing them to rate wineries and provide comments.

Tools that will be used in the implementation of this project include various resources, including the open-source service of OpenStreetMap, through which location data and other information will be extracted and filtered.
